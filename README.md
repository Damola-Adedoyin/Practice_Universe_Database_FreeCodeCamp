### Summary
This is a practice project of a demo database of celestial bodies that was built using SQL.
The project focuses on the fundamentals of a relational database by **creating a PostgreSQL database** using a command line interface (CLI) through a Visual Studio Code terminal. In the end, the source code was dumped into the `universe.sql` file.
